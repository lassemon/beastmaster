Ranger Homebrew Fixes
=====

### Ranger class

#### Hunter's Mark
 - Hunter's Mark is a Bonus Action and is Concentration. The Ranger can Concentrate on Hunter’s Mark in addition to one other Ranger Spell that does not give you extra attacks.
   (Each time you make a concentration save, you roll once; on a failure, both drop)
 - If the your Hunter's Marked target drops to 0HP, you can choose another target that you can see within range as a Free Action on your turn or a Reaction on someone elses turn (otherwise choosing a new target takes a Bonus Action).
 - If you are a dual wielder, the Hunter's Mark die for your offhand hit is always 1d4 at lower Ranger levels and 1d6 at level 5 and beyond
 - The Hunter's Mark can trigger on a maximum of three of your weapon or Primal Companions hits each turn.

##### Hunter's Mark damage die table:
| lvl | die |
| --- | --- |
| 3   | d4  |
| 5   | d6  |
| 9   | d8  |
| 12  | d10 |
| 17  | d12 |


###### Ranger Level 17: Precise Hunter
You can now score a Critical Hit on a roll of 18–20 on your Hunter's Marked target (does not include Primal Companion attacks).

###### Level 20: Foe Slayer
If your Hunter's Marked target is below 50% HP, your weapon attacks against it deal damage as if the target were vulnerable, ignoring resistance.
Vulnerability ends if the target regenerates above 50% or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.


### Beast Master subclass

###### 3.1 Primal Companion variety
You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature, the beast can take multiple forms.
You can you use your action to touch your beast and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to change the beasts form.

Your beast form can be any beast from the official rulebooks of varying Challenge Rating according to the following table:

| lvl | CR  |
| --- | --- |
| -   | 1/8 |
| 5   | 1/4 |
| 9   | 1/2 |
| 11  | 1   |
| 15  | 2   |

- If the beast form has neither fly speed or swim speed the Primal Companion must be a Beast of the Land
- If the beasts highest speed type is fly speed the Primal Companion must be a Beast of the Sky

- If the beast has two or more speeds equally high (must be highest speed) you can choose between the appropriate Primal Companion Beast type for that speed
- You cannot mount your Primal Companion
- Once per Short Rest, you can use your action to comprehend and verbally communicate with your Primal Companion for 1 minute.
- The HP and AC are of the beast form you choose from the official source, but they cannot exceed the HP and AC described in the Primal Companion Beast type table in the Players Handbook for a given type, otherwise the beasts stats are unchanged from the official source.
    - Land: AC 13 + Your WIS Modifier, HP 5 + 5x Ranger Level
    - Sea:  AC 13 + Your WIS Modifier, HP 5 + 5x Ranger Level
    - Sky:  AC 13 + Your WIS Modifier, HP 5 + 4x Ranger Level

 - Any Save DC or escape DC of your Primal Companion form is always your own Spell Save DC
 - A creature that frees itself from a Primal Companions grapple is immune to that companion's grapple until the end of the companions next turn.
 - A Primal Companion summoned this way cannot make multiattacks and can take only one Attack per turn even if the beast description would describe otherwise, but otherwise its stats remain as they are.
